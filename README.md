### A Smart Suit for Patients with Paralysis using Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

<h4><i>We present a smart wearable suit/ "Upper-Limb Exoskeleton" that provides paralyzed people with motion assistance.
It helps them regain some functions such as grasping different objects with variable geometric parameters using the hand exoskeleton.
By using the patients voice, he will be able to grab things and move his hand by sending voice commands to the mobile application that has many features like remote monitoring of the patient and sending messages in case of emergencies to the mentor and observing the suits battery status by the mentor.</i></h4><br>
