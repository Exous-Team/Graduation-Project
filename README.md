### A Smart Suit for Patients with Paralysis using Artificial Intelligence and Robotics


<h4><i>We present a smart wearable suit/ "Upper-Limb Exoskeleton" controlled by voice commands.
By using the patient`s voice, he will be able to grab things based on computer vision concepts and move his hand by sending voice commands to the mobile application that has many features like remote monitoring of the patient and sending messages in case of emergencies to the mentor and observing the suit`s battery status by the mentor.<br>
We also used Simulation/AR to test the functionality of the exoskeleton in a virtual environment.</i></h4>
